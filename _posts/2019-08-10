# Dark Forest

The dark forest lies everywhere.  A dark forest is the place of deception. The trees are both thin, scrawny and tall and luscious, of a green tone so dark that is almost blue. The bed of forest is so dry that the fallen leaves crack incessantly at every step but it is also so humid that every step will get stuck in putrescent clays and rotten layers humus. At times the fog will embrace the trunks and connect them and make them appear as the structural components of a skeletal ghost, at times the air is so clear and crisp that every little crest of the barks is visible, and the endless presence of the tree trunks is elemental. Of course in the forest monsters are lurking, waiting for blood and nightmares. Rats are running and take refuge in little tiny holes between the roots. With their Yellow fangs and black eyes they stare out of those dark holes.
The dark forest is the landing place after falling from the sky, after exiting the great deception the bubble of the paint fake home, where the safe lies dominate. Where the smiling mum holds you in the tepid womb.
