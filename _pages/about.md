Why the need for a personal site? Because it is a personal space, not controlled by anyone. That was the initial goal of the internet, but this has been hijacked by big corporations, big tech. __Leviathans__ that have power over what you think and believe. But what you believe is what you are. So, if you don't like what you see and read, let me be who I am and fuck off.
Slaying the dragon. Taming imperfection. Reaching the light.
